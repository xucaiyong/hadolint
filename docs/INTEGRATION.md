# Hadolint Integrations

## Codacy

[Codacy](https://www.codacy.com/) automates hadolint code reviews on every
commit and pull request, reporting code style and error prone issues.

## Travis CI

Integration with Travis CI requires minimal changes and adding less than
two seconds to your build time.

```yaml
# Use container-based infrastructure for quicker build start-up
sudo: false
# Use generic image to cut start-up time
language: generic
env:
  # Path to 'hadolint' binary
  HADOLINT: "${HOME}/hadolint"
install:
  # Download hadolint binary and set it as executable
  - curl -sL -o ${HADOLINT} "https://github.com/hadolint/hadolint/releases/download/v1.16.0/hadolint-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)"
    && chmod 700 ${HADOLINT}
script:
  # List files which name starts with 'Dockerfile'
  # eg. Dockerfile, Dockerfile.build, etc.
  - git ls-files --exclude='Dockerfile*' --ignored | xargs --max-lines=1 ${HADOLINT}
```

## GitHub Actions

For GitHub you can build on the existing docker image with debian to
run through all the Dockerfiles in your repository and print out a list of issues.
You can find an example implementation
[here](https://github.com/cds-snc/github-actions/tree/master/docker-lint).
Your workflow might look something like this (feel free to use the provided Docker
image `cdssnc/docker-lint` or create your own):

```hcl
workflow "Lint Dockerfiles" {
  on = "push"
  resolves = ["Lint all the files"]
}

action "Lint all the files" {
  uses = "docker://cdssnc/docker-lint"
}
```

## Gitlab CI

For GitLab CI you need a basic shell in your docker image so you have to use
the debian based images of hadolint.

Add the following job to your project's `.gitlab-ci.yml`:

```yaml
lint_dockerfile:
  stage: lint
  image: hadolint/hadolint:latest-debian
  script:
    - hadolint Dockerfile
```

## Drone CI

For Drone CI, a basic shell is similiarly required.

Add the following job to your project's `.drone.yml` pipeline (drone version 0.8 or earlier):

```yaml
  hadolint:
    group: validate
    image: hadolint/hadolint:latest-debian
    commands:
      - hadolint --version
      - hadolint Dockerfile
```

Add the following job to your project's `.drone.yml` pipeline (drone version 1.0 or later):

```yaml
  - name: hadolint
    image: hadolint/hadolint:latest-debian
    commands:
      - hadolint --version
      - hadolint  Dockerfile
```

## CircleCI

For CircleCI integration use the [docker orb](https://circleci.com/orbs/registry/orb/circleci/docker).
Update your project's `.circleci/config.yml` pipeline (workflows version 2.1),
adding the docker orb and you can call the job docker/hadolint:

```yaml
orbs:
  docker: circleci/docker@x.y.z
version: 2.1
workflows:
  lint:
    jobs:
      - docker/hadolint:
          dockerfile: path/to/Dockerfile
          ignore-rules: 'DL4005,DL3008'
          trusted-registries: 'docker.io,my-company.com:5000'
```

## Jenkins declarative pipeline

You can add a step during your CI process to lint and archive the output of hadolint

```groovy
stage ("lint dockerfile") {
    agent {
        docker {
            image 'hadolint/hadolint:latest-debian'
        }
    }
    steps {
        sh 'hadolint dockerfiles/* | tee -a hadolint_lint.txt'
    }
    post {
        always {
            archiveArtifacts 'hadolint_lint.txt'
        }
    }
}
```

## Codeship Pro

Add the hadolint docker container on codeship-services.yml with a docker volume
with the repository attached to it:

```yaml
hadolint:
  image: hadolint/hadolint:latest-debian
  volumes:
    - ./:/test
```

Then add the CI step on codeship-steps.yml with the path of the dockerfile

```yaml
- type: parallel
  # optional: set branches
  tag: '^(master|develop/.*)$'
  steps:
    - service: hadolint
      command: hadolint /test/Dockerfile
```

## Bitbucket Pipelines

Create a `bitbucket-pipelines.yml` configuration file:
```yaml
pipelines:
  default:
    - step:
        image: hadolint/hadolint:latest-debian
        script:
          - hadolint Dockerfile
```

## Editors

Using hadolint in your terminal is not always the most convinient way, but it
can be integrated into your editor to give you a feedback as you write your
Dockerfile.

### Atom

> Atom is a text editor that's modern, approachable, yet hackable to the coreâ€”a
> tool you can customize to do anything but also use productively without ever
> touching a config file.

Thanks to [lucasdf][], there is an integration [linter-hadolint][] with
[Atom][].

### Sublime Text 3

> A sophisticated text editor for code, markup and prose.

Thanks to [niksite][], there is an integration
[SublimeLinter-contrib-hadolint][] with [Sublime Text][].

### Vim and NeoVim

Hadolint is used in two plugins:

-   [Syntastic][] - syntax checking plugin for Vim created by Martin Grenfell.

-   [ALE][] (Asynchronous Lint Engine) - plugin for providing linting in NeoVim
    and Vim 8 while you edit your text files.

### VS Code

> Visual Studio Code is a lightweight but powerful source code editor which
> runs on your desktop and is available for Windows, macOS and Linux.

There is an integration [vscode-hadolint][] with [VS Code][], built by [ExiaSR][].

### Geany

> Geany is a powerful, stable and lightweight programmer's text editor
> that provides tons of useful features without bogging down your workflow.
> It runs on Linux, Windows and MacOS is translated into over 40 languages,
> and has built-in support for more than 50 programming languages.

The following can be used as a
[build action](https://www.geany.org/manual/current/index.html#build-menu-commands-dialog)
to
[lint](https://www.geany.org/manual/current/index.html#lint) Dockerfiles.

```sh
if docker run --rm -i hadolint/hadolint < "%d/%f"
| sed -re 's|^/dev/stdin:([0-9]*)|%d/%f:\1:WARNING:|'
| grep -EC100 ':WARNING:' ; then exit 1 ; else exit 0 ; fi
```
